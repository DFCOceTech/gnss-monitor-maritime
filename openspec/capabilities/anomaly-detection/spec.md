# Anomaly Detection — Specification

> Version: 1.2 | Status: Implemented | Last updated: 2026-05-09

## Purpose

Detect GNSS signal anomalies (jamming, spoofing, multipath/degradation) using two complementary approaches: hardware threshold checks and statistical deviation from a computed baseline.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-DET-001: Baseline Establishment
The system SHALL compute a baseline of normal signal characteristics (C/N0 mean, satellite count, AGC, noise) from a configurable rolling time window (default 1 h, minimum 100 samples, maximum 24 h).

### REQ-DET-002: Threshold Jamming Detection
The system SHALL detect jamming when: (a) MON-RF jammingState ≥ configured warn level (default 2) OR jamInd ≥ configured threshold (default 80), per RF band; OR (b) SEC-SIG reports `jammed=1` on any monitored center frequency.

### REQ-DET-003: Threshold Spoofing Detection
The system SHALL detect spoofing when SEC-SIG `spoofingState` ≥ configured warn level (default 2). SEC-SIG is the authoritative spoofing source; NAV-STATUS `spoofDetState` is used as fallback when SEC-SIG is unavailable.

### REQ-DET-009: OSNMA Authentication Detection
The system SHALL detect spoofing when any Galileo signal reports `authStatus=2` (unauthenticated) in NAV-SIG. This event SHALL have severity=critical. When firmware does not support OSNMA, all authStatus values will be 0 (unknown) and no events will fire.

### REQ-DET-004: Statistical Detection
The system SHALL detect anomalies when any monitored metric deviates from baseline by more than `zscore_threshold` standard deviations (default 3.0).

### REQ-DET-005: Monitored Statistical Metrics
Statistical detection SHALL cover: satellite count (drop), C/N0 mean (drop = jamming, uniform rise = spoofing indicator), AGC count per band (spike = jamming).

### REQ-DET-006: Event Deduplication
The system SHALL create at most one open event per anomaly type/band; subsequent samples during the same anomaly SHALL NOT create duplicate events.

### REQ-DET-007: Event Attribution
Each event SHALL carry: event_type, severity (warning/critical), attribution text, and metric values at time of detection.

### REQ-DET-008: Baseline User Control
The user SHALL be able to set the baseline duration via the dashboard (0.25–24 h range).

### REQ-DET-010: Dead-Reckoning Position-Jump Detection
When vessel speed ≥ `min_speed_for_dr_mps` (default 0.5 m/s), the system SHALL estimate the expected current position by integrating the last known NED velocity over the elapsed time since the previous sample. If the haversine distance between the actual and dead-reckoning position exceeds `position_jump_threshold_m` (default 100 m), the system SHALL create a critical severity spoofing event. Both position and velocity would need to be spoofed coherently to evade this check.

### REQ-DET-011: Velocity-Gated Baseline
The baseline SHALL only be updated from samples where `speed_mps < baseline_max_speed_mps` (default 0.5 m/s). This ensures the baseline reflects anchor/port conditions rather than underway sea-state multipath.

### SCENARIO-DET-004: Dead-Reckoning Position Jump
**GIVEN** vessel moving at 5 m/s, baseline established
**WHEN** reported position jumps 500 m from dead-reckoning estimate in one cycle
**THEN** one critical spoofing event of type 'spoofing' is created with deviation_m in metric_values

## Acceptance Scenarios

### SCENARIO-DET-001: Hardware Jamming
**GIVEN** baseline established, MON-RF jammingState rises to 2 on band 0
**WHEN** next sample processed
**THEN** one event of type 'jamming' with severity 'warning' is created; no duplicate on next sample

### SCENARIO-DET-002: Statistical C/N0 Drop
**GIVEN** baseline established with cn0_mean=38.0 std=2.0
**WHEN** current cn0_mean drops to 28.0 (z=-5.0, below threshold of 3.0)
**THEN** event of type 'jamming' created with z_score in metric_values

### SCENARIO-DET-003: Baseline Not Ready
**GIVEN** fewer than min_samples collected
**WHEN** sample processed
**THEN** statistical checks skipped; hardware threshold checks still run

## Implementation Status (2026-05-09)

**Status**: Implemented and deployed

### What's Built
- `src/gnss_monitor/detector.py` — AnomalyDetector with _AlertTracker for deduplication
- `src/gnss_monitor/baseline.py` — BaselineManager with rolling window from SQLite
- Threshold checks: `_check_jamming()` (MON-RF + SEC-SIG per-frequency), `_check_spoofing()` (SEC-SIG authoritative), `_check_osnma()` (NAV-SIG authStatus)
- Statistical checks: `_check_statistical()` covering num_sv, cn0_mean, AGC per band
- Uniform C/N0 rise spoofing heuristic (statistical)
- `FREQ_NAMES` dict mapping SEC-SIG center frequencies (kHz) to human-readable band labels

### Observed Behaviour (baseline from ~600 samples, 2026-05-07)
- numSV baseline: mean=24.30, std=0.809
- h_acc_m baseline: mean=0.83 m, std=0.019 m
- pdop baseline: mean=0.99, std=0.021
- cn0_mean baseline: mean=37.01 dBHz, std=1.346 dBHz
- At zscore_threshold=3.0, normal dips to 22 SVs trigger stat_sv_drop events (false positives)
- Consider raising zscore_threshold to 3.5–4.0 once more baseline data is collected
