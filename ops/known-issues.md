# Known Issues

## KI-001: pyubx2 repeated-group attribute naming — RESOLVED
**Status**: Resolved (2026-05-09)
**Description**: pyubx2 1.3.0 repeated-group field names assumed to use zero-padded 2-digit suffix (`_01`, `_02`, …).
**Resolution**: Confirmed on ZED-X20P — all NAV-SAT and MON-RF fields use the `_01`…`_NN` suffix. Direct named attributes confirmed: `cno_01`, `gnssId_01`, `jammingState_01`, `agcCnt_01`, `jamInd_01`, etc.

## KI-002: Packages installed as user site-packages
**Status**: Monitored
**Description**: pip installed pyubx2 and flask-socketio to `~/.local/` (obs-pi-01 home). The systemd service sets `PYTHONPATH` to the versioned path `/home/obs-pi-01/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages`. If Python version changes, this path must be updated in the service file.
**Mitigation**: After deploy, verify `sudo systemctl status gnss-monitor` shows no ImportError.

## KI-003: MON-RF jammingState field location — RESOLVED
**Status**: Resolved (2026-05-09)
**Description**: Interface description suggested jammingState might be packed in bits 1:0 of `flags` byte rather than exposed as a named attribute.
**Resolution**: Confirmed on ZED-X20P — `jammingState_01` is a direct named attribute in pyubx2 1.3.0. The flags-bit fallback path in collector.py can be removed in a future cleanup.

## KI-004: Serial read loop and NAV-PVT polling — RESOLVED
**Status**: Resolved (2026-05-09)
**Description**: Two related issues: (1) original `in_waiting`-based read loop exited on momentary buffer gaps; (2) NAV-PVT poll response is deferred by the device to the next 1 Hz nav epoch, so a 0.5 s collection window missed it ~80% of cycles. Additionally, `reset_input_buffer()` was discarding auto-output NAV-SAT/NAV-STATUS bytes before collection began.
**Resolution**: Collection window extended to 1.1 s (covers full nav epoch wait); `reset_input_buffer()` removed from poll cycle; explicit polls kept for all 4 messages to guarantee per-cycle delivery regardless of auto-output timing. Dashboard confirmed live with all panels populated.

## KI-005: Statistical false positives at zscore_threshold=3.0
**Status**: Open — baseline reset in progress
**Description**: Old baseline (established at previous antenna location) caused immediate stat_agc_band0 false-positive alerts after antenna relocation. baseline_stats table cleared manually on 2026-05-09 to force reestablishment from new location. With numSV std=0.809 on the old baseline, normal dips to 22–23 SVs also produced spurious `stat_sv_drop` events.
**Mitigation**: Allow new baseline to establish (~100 samples / ~2 min). Once stable, consider raising `detection.statistical.zscore_threshold` in `config.yaml` to 3.5–4.0 to reduce sv_drop false positives.
**Operational note**: To reset baseline after antenna relocation: `DELETE FROM baseline_stats` in the SQLite DB. The service picks up the cleared baseline at next startup.

## KI-007: OSNMA requires firmware update
**Status**: Open
**Description**: ZED-X20P firmware HPG 2.02 does not support Galileo OSNMA. `CFG-OSNMA` config group is unknown to ubxtool, and all NAV-SIG `authStatus` values remain 0 (unknown). The OSNMA detection pipeline and dashboard panel are fully implemented and will activate automatically once the device runs a firmware version that supports OSNMA.
**Resolution**: Update firmware via u-blox u-center (Windows). User intends to do this. After update, re-probe SEC-SIG and NAV-SIG to confirm authStatus values.

## KI-006: systemd service requires interactive sudo for restart
**Status**: Open
**Description**: `sudo systemctl restart gnss-monitor-maritime` fails over non-interactive SSH (`sudo: a terminal is required`). The service can only be restarted from an interactive Pi terminal session.
**Mitigation**: Add a NOPASSWD sudoers rule for the specific systemctl command, or use `sudo -S` with password piped in deploy.sh.

## KI-008: Velocity field scaling unverified underway
**Status**: Open — pending sea trial
**Description**: `gSpeed` is assumed to be a raw integer in mm/s (multiplied by 1e-3 for m/s). `headMot` is assumed to be pre-scaled to degrees by pyubx2. `velN/E/D` are assumed mm/s. None of these assumptions have been verified against an independent reference (ship's log, compass) at sea.
**Mitigation**: On first underway transit, compare `speed_kn` in the dashboard against ship's log speed. If reads ~1.944× too high, remove the `× 1e-3` scaling from `_parse_pvt()`. Verify `course_deg` tracks compass heading at speed > 1 kn.

## KI-009: Dead-reckoning threshold not field-validated
**Status**: Open — pending sea trial
**Description**: `position_jump_threshold_m` is set to 100 m as a reasonable starting value, but has not been validated at sea. Actual GPS wander underway depends on sea state, antenna motion, and multipath. The threshold may need tuning to avoid false positives in rough conditions or false negatives against slow-drift spoofing.
**Mitigation**: Monitor DR deviation during first sea trial; log `deviation_m` from any position_jump events. Adjust `config.yaml` accordingly.

## KI-010: Baseline speed gate may be too tight in mild current
**Status**: Open
**Description**: `baseline_max_speed_mps = 0.5` (≈1 knot) excludes samples during slow tidal drift or swinging at anchor in current. In strong tidal areas, the vessel may rarely be below 0.5 m/s even at anchor, causing the baseline to never update.
**Mitigation**: Monitor `baseline_samples` in the dashboard when at anchor. If it stays at 0 despite being anchored, raise `vessel.baseline_max_speed_mps` in `config.yaml` (e.g., to 1.0 m/s).
